<p>Hey guys! I'm Andrew, I'm 21 and I'm a Masters student at <a href = 
"https://www.surrey.ac.uk/business-school">Surrey University</a> studying 
Business Analytics. I completed my Bachelors in Physics at <a href =
"http://www.imperial.ac.uk">Imperial College London</a>.</p>

<p>After learning about physics at Imperial, and also after reading <a href=
"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emperors-New-Mind-Concerning-Computers/dp/0198784929/
ref=dp_ob_title_bk">The Emperor's New Mind</a> by Sir Roger Penrose, I was inspired
to learn constantly about as much of the world as I could. So now, this blog is
dedicated to my thoughts and findings on my journey, and hopefully any users of my 
site can find something useful to them. If not that, then hopefully something mildly 
interesting to read at least :smiley:.</p>
