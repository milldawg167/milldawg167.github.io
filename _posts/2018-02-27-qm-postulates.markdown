## Summary:

This is a brief summary (I promise) of the Postulates of Quantum Mechanics, as stated by the Copenhagen Convention.

### Key Postualtes
- Associated with any particle moving in a conservative field of force is a wave function which determines everything that can be known about the system.
- With every physical observable q there is associated an operator Q, which when operating upon the wavefunction associated with a definite value of that observable will yield that value times the wavefunction.
- Any operator Q associated with a physically measurable property q will be Hermitian.
- The set of eigenfunctions of operator Q will form a complete set of linearly independent functions.
- For a system described by a given wavefunction, the expectation value of any property q can be found by performing the expectation value integral with respect to that wavefunction.
-The time evolution of the wavefunction is given by the time dependent Schrodinger equation.
